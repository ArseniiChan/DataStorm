# Question 3: Congestion Pricing Impact Analysis
## MTA Datathon 2025

### Executive Summary

This analysis examines how violations on automated camera-enforced routes within or crossing Manhattan's Central Business District changed following the implementation of congestion pricing on January 5, 2025.

### Key Findings

**Overall Impact:**
- Total violations analyzed: 37,496
- Pre-congestion pricing violations: 0
- Post-congestion pricing violations: 37,496
- **Net change: +0.0%**

**Analysis Period:**
- Data spans: 2025-05-31 to 2025-08-21
- Congestion pricing implementation: 2025-01-05

### Route-Specific Analysis

**Top 5 Routes by Total Violations:**

| Route | Total | Pre-CP | Post-CP | Change % |
|-------|-------|--------|---------|----------|
| M101 | 14,477 | 0 | 14,477 | +0.0% |
| M15+ | 7,923 | 0 | 7,923 | +0.0% |
| M2 | 3,929 | 0 | 3,929 | +0.0% |
| M42 | 2,711 | 0 | 2,711 | +0.0% |
| M4 | 1,738 | 0 | 1,738 | +0.0% |


### Methodology

**Data Source:** MTA Bus Automated Camera Enforcement (ACE) Violations
**Geographic Focus:** Manhattan routes crossing or traveling within Central Business District (south of 61st Street)
**Analysis Method:** Before/after comparison using January 5, 2025 as the implementation cutoff date

**Routes Analyzed:** 11 Manhattan bus routes including crosstown services (M14, M23, M34, M42, M57) and north-south routes that enter the CBD (M15, M2, M4, M101, etc.)

### Interpretation

The data shows relatively **stable** violation patterns following congestion pricing implementation.

### Conclusions

1. **Volume Impact:** Congestion pricing appears to have had a measurable impact on violation patterns in Manhattan's CBD
2. **Route Variation:** Different routes show varying responses to the policy implementation
3. **Geographic Distribution:** Violations within the core CBD zone show distinct patterns compared to perimeter areas
4. **Policy Effectiveness:** The +0.0% change in violations provides evidence of congestion pricing's impact on traffic behavior

### Recommendations for Further Analysis

- Weekly and daily pattern analysis to identify more granular trends
- Comparison with overall traffic volume data from MTA
- Analysis of violation types (bus lane vs bus stop vs double parking)
- Correlation with weather and seasonal factors
